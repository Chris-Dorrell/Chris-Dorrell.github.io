<p>Growth is the key word for Liz Truss; it is the criteria by which she wants her government to be judged and the defining line – as she sees it – between her government and the governments that have come before. Her opponents, both in her party and outside, are the “anti-growth coalition.”</p>
<p>Though her growth strategy is multifaceted, an important strand of it is her more relaxed approach to fossil fuel production. The business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, that knob, said that UK needed to get “every last drop” of oil from the North Sea. Last week the government issued opened bidding for 100 offshore licenses despite the concerns of climate activists. </p>
<p>Even more controversially, the government hopes fracking can generate the kind of boom it did in the US a decade ago which has helped the US nearly equal Saudi Arabia in oil exports and make ‘energy independence’ a realistic goal. </p>
<p>Shares in independent oil and gas companies in the UK have risen dramatically thanks to higher oil prices and the prospect of a fracking boom. Shares in IGas Energy have risen 254% this year, Egdon Resources is up 200%, while Union Jack Oil is up 66%.</p>
<p>But fracking is unlikely to be the transformative growth generator that both the government and the oil companies think it will be, even aside from the environmental arguments. </p>
<p>Responding to questions about the fracking decision on her difficult media round last Thursday morning, the Prime Minister said the moratorium would only be lifted “where there is local community support.” </p>
<p>The government’s own polls put the numbers against fracking at 46%. Only 29% are in favour. More damaging still for the already politically weak Prime Minister is the lack of support amongst Conservative MPs. Tory MPs angrily challenged the Business secretary Jacob Rees Mogg in the House of Commons when the plans were announced. It’s not difficult to see why: 94 Conservatives have constituencies with licences in them and many of them are in swing seats. Securing meaningful local support seems unlikely. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would not be beyond the realms of possibility for a government elected by 0.12% of the population to have a broader than average definition of “community support.” It’s therefore worth reminding the government why fracking is so unpopular. </p>
<p>Although there are other issues, the single most important factor behind the fracking ban was earthquakes.</p>
<p>Fracking has been halted twice already in the UK. First in 2011 when tremors were detected in Blackpool after drilling nearby. Cuadrilla, still the only company to have fracked in the UK, resumed work in 2018, promising to adhere strictly to limits on seismic activity. It didn’t. In 2019, an earthquake measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale was reported – 251 times the accepted limit – and after that the government issued the moratorium. Cuadrilla has since been lobbying for an increase in the limit of acceptable seismic activity. </p>
<p>In his statement to the House of Commons, Rees Mogg addressed the issue somewhat circuitously: “forecasting the occurrence of felt seismic events remains a scientific challenge for the geoscience community. It also makes clear that to improve our understanding we need more exploratory sites to gather the necessary data.”</p>
<p>But there are two problems. First, admitting that the policy isn’t based on a clear evidence base seems unlikely to generate consent in the local community. Second, Rees Mogg said “tolerating a higher degree of risk and disturbance appears to us to be in the national interest given the circumstances”. If Rees Mogg can only justify fracking’s recommencement by raising the threshold of seismic activity, it would almost look like he thought there was a connection between fracking and earthquakes. </p>
<p>Aside from issues of consent, a more fundamental issue is that there simply isn’t as much gas as the government – and the oil and gas companies - thinks there is. Government reports suggest that there was enough gas to supply the UK for decades, but many geologists argue that the UK’s geology simply does not support the scale of fracking that the government envisages.  </p>
<P>Stuart Hazeldine, Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh said “the UK did have a lot of onshore shale oil and gas, a long time ago. But because the country has the wrong geological history, that oil and gas has long gone, flowed out along the abundant faults and fractures. American and Canadian geology is much simpler, and that’s why their shale gas is still there.”</P>
<p> “If the UK wants to develop a major US-style fracking industry”, Hazeldine writes, “it is 280 million years too late.”</p>
<p>Truss’s fracking policy is in danger of adding a majority of the UK’s population and a good portion of its rocks to the anti-growth coalition. </p>
