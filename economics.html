            Liz Truss’s premiership is in tatters, and no bad thing. It was deeply
            misguided, and its attempted application was deeply incompetent. But
            leaving aside the politics and the personalities, there is something more
            interesting going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the decade or so following the 2008 financial crisis, economic policy
            has been built on loose monetary policy and restricted fiscal policy. While
            in the short term this combination may have avoided total economic
            meltdown, the longer-term recovery has been weak. Truss is right to argue
            that the economic orthodoxy has failed, even if she is an unusual
            messenger.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the broadest possible terms, Trussonomics is for tighter monetary policy
            and looser fiscal policy, something that critics of the economic orthodoxy
            from all political stripes would be likely to agree with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with monetary policy. From 2008 until the beginning of this year,
            interest rates in the UK have been below 1%. Advanced economies around the
            globe have seen similarly low levels. In that time the Bank of England has
            also been engaging in large scale bond-buying – quantitative easing – in
            order to stimulate demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this policy framework has avoided a depression, it can hardly be said
            to have generated a recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bank of England more or less admits that quantitative easing has stoked
            inequality as the liquidity arising from the bond-buying programme gets
            stuck in financial markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            A prolonged period of low interest rates, meanwhile, has benefited
            homeowners but there is an argument – an argument which lies beneath the
            Truss agenda – that it has created a series of zombie businesses and hugely
            overpriced financial assets in place of meaningful economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patrick Minford, one of the few economists to support her leadership bid,
            argued that “interest rates have to go up…A normal level is more like
            5%-7%, and I don’t think it will be any bad thing if we got back to that
            level.” More expensive mortgages would be “part of the adjustment” while a
            higher cost of borrowing would eradicate “zombie companies”, which only
            survived through low interest rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Higher interest rates were therefore an integral part of Truss’s economic
            vision, even if she herself was reluctant to admit it. We shall see why.
        </p>
        <p>
            Truss’s fiscal policy – such as it was – used debt to fund tax cuts on
            corporations and the rich in the name of boosting growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most advanced economics since 2008, fiscal policy has been restricted.
            In the UK the government was intently focused on bringing the deficit down
            through spending cuts to reduce the debt to GDP ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was not important for Truss. She wanted to grow the economy out of its
            debt.
        </p>
        <p>
            In itself, this was not a bad aim. The UK’s debt has hardly budged as
            massive spending cuts prolonged the downturn before Covid added another
            mountain of debt on top. In Greece, all the different rounds of spending
            cuts after the financial crisis increased the government’s debt because the
            economy grew more slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making deficit reduction the main aim of government policy was not a
            successful policy in either case.
        </p>
        <p>
            The twin arms of Trussonomics then have some appeal, at least in the
            abstract. Gerard Lyons – another Truss supporting economist – argued in the
            New Statesman that many of Truss’s aims, “including the need for more
            investment” and the need “for fiscal policy to be used more proactively in
            delivering growth” rather than obsessing “over the budget deficit”, have
            long been popular among left wing thinkers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many problems with Truss’s plan, but an aspect which the left
            need to be wary of is the damage that rising interest rates can cause.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be summarised in one word: mortgages. Interest rates are going to
            have to rise further and faster than they otherwise would because of
            Truss’s tax plans, or indeed any more expansive fiscal policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is particularly bad news for homeowners, many of whom are on fixed
            rate mortgages coming up for renewal in the next couple of years. They will
            suddenly find themselves paying hundreds of pounds more in repayments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commentators have noted that Trussonomics isn’t likely to work because the
            UK is already a relatively low tax, low regulation economy. It is also an
            economy with much of its resources tied to the housing sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Thatcher the number of homeowners increased from 9.7 million to 12.8
            million. Increasing demand for houses, fuelled by credit from the financial
            sector, led to huge increases in house prices which have continued into the
            21<sup>st</sup> Century even as first-time buyers are priced out of the
            market.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those repaying mortgages in the wake of the financial crisis, low
            interest rates helped to cushion the blow by ensuring that repayments
            remained relatively low. By the same token, low interest rates stimulated
            demand helping house prices to continue rising. Crucially, it meant
            homeowners avoided negative equity, when the size of a mortgage exceeds the
            value of the property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Truss’s policy forced interest rates to rise by more than they were already
            going to. This would risk causing a crisis in the housing market in which
            homeowners are saddled with debts they cannot pay and properties they
            cannot sell.
        </p>
        <p>
            This logic applies equally to the left. An expansive fiscal programme, no
            matter its stripe, will necessitate an increase in interest rates. This is
            potentially very damaging in an inflationary environment where interest
            rates are already rising. So, how can one smoothly move away from the
            current policy matrix of loose monetary policy and restrictive fiscal
            policy?
